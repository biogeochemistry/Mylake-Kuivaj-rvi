MyLake C (2018)

Written by Petri Kiuru (petri.j.kiuru@jyu.fi)

This version of MyLake includes novel descriptions of dissolved oxygen and organic carbon (with 3 pools of DOC and 2 pools of POC) as well as a description of dissolved organic carbon species. The version is partly based on MyLake DOCOMO (see https://github.com/biogeochemistry/MyLake_public)

This version has no manual. The model will be presented in an upcoming article.

MyLake_C_KJ.m is a script for running the model application for Lake Kuivajärvi. The model input data for the application and the measurement data used in the figures are found in the I_O submodule. The model code for Mylake is located in the submodules vC and air_sea.
